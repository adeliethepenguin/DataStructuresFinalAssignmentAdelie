When you run it you will be prompted for inputs. If you input something wrong then it will not work properly and the program will terminate. It also terminates on completion of any of the options so run it again if you want to try it multiple times.

Also, you can edit the file to edit the nodes. You only need to add each edge once without repeats. Add edges and their weights with the following structure: nodeA nodeB weight
Which will be both connecting nodes and the weight of the node. I've set the program to use integers since the given rubric only used integers.
Also, remember the nodes must be char.
Furthermore, the 1 and 3 option will not work correctly unless you have H, K, Q, T as nodes since those were manually set as charging stations in the program.
